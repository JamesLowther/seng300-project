## Getting Started

To run the program, copy the `Journals.json` and `Users.json` files from `test-data/` into the project's root directory.
It includes a two starter editor accounts with username `editor-1` and `editor-2` each with the password `1234`.
Each of these accounts has its own journal, and each journal has two volumes.

Other user accounts (researchers and reviewers) need to be generated at runtime.
